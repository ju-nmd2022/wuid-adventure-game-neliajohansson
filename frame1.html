        It's the morning of Christmas Eve and you're on the train on your way to
        your Grandma's house. You get off the train and watch as the it leaves
        again when you suddenly notice you have stepped off one station too
        early. You hurry to look up the next departure time only to realize it
        was the only train of the day and your only chance to get to your
        Grandma's house in time for the celebrations. With a deep sigh you
        realize you have two choices: either you walk to the small village in
        front of you and wait there until the next morning - missing all of the
        Christmas celebrations - or you walk through the deep snow and hope you
        find your way to your Grandma's village somewhere on the other side of
        the forest. It's still dark outside and the icy winter morning air
        forces itself inside your jacket. You look longingly towards the warmth
        inside the cabins, but ultimately decide you can't leave your Grandma
        alone on Christmas Eve.
