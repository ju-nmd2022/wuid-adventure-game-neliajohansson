        You crossed the river safely and finally you recognize where you are.
        The big tree in front of you is home to a bunch of the forest birds, and
        happen to be located just in front of your Grandma's village. The birds
        are known for their appetite and will swarm around you if you don't
        bring them something to eat. The safest way to get past them is simply
        to feed them.
